Apple style combo for Windows

## Why Apple style?

This happens when I want to work with `Vim` or `Emacs` but still need to copy,
paste with others application, and the right hand sits on the mouse.

Since `Ctrl`+`ZXCV` sequence are all busy with other bindings, let's try
`Windows` with Apple style.

# Basic maps

- `Windows`+`ZXCV` map to `Undo`, `Cut`, `Copy`, `Paste` in all applications,
except `Vim` and `Emacs`. They have literate meaning, and available to map to
one's need.

- `Windows`+`C` works in `Console`, too. `Windows`+`V` works
naturally with [clink] support.

- [RSI] motion `npfbae`

- Some other common bindings: `Windows`+`ASNTW`

- More is comming...
